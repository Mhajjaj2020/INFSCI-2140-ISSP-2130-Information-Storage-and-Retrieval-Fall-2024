Download Docker Desktop: Install Docker Desktop and use it to run the docker-compose file in the directory where you want to store everything.

Set Up a Virtual Environment: Create a virtual environment (venv) and uncomment all the pip install lines in the provided Jupyter notebook. You may need to set an admin password; in our case, it’s Strong_password1.

Run the Jupyter Notebook: Execute every line in the notebook (except the installation lines you’ve already completed). Indexing may take some time. If you encounter a memory circuit error, rerun the corresponding segment of code.

Access the Application: Once indexing is complete, click on the Flask link provided in the notebook. This should allow you to perform searches. Please note that the dates will be randomized, so the results may vary slightly.

Testing: The code has primarily been tested with shorter queries like "leg protector," "foot," and "armor," which worked well in our experience.
